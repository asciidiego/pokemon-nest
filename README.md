# Pokemon Nest app
## Description

This is a nest application intended to be run on a [repl.it](https://www.repl.it).

The application has (atm) a single endpoint (`/pokemon/{id}`) and it returns the response from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co). It caches the responses using a TTL of 60 seconds. This repl.it is for hackers, not for jerks.

## To-do
- [ ] Improve documentation
- [ ] Apply clean architecture so that it can be used as a template

$ npm install
